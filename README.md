# Recursive Algorithms

Recursion is a leading technique to develope powerfull algorithms. It's a must for every software developer to know some popular recursive algortihm. 

Iterative algorithms are like eating a bread by slicing. You know the number of slice and eat a slice at every iteration. Recursive algorithms, on the other hand, are like eating a bread by snatching pieces from it until there is nothing left.

This projects provides java implementations of popular recursive algorithms. Additionally, it includes resursive versions of algorithms such as summing or searching the elements of an arbitrary array, which are generally coded iteratively.
